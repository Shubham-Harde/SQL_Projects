## Problem Statement:
In a competitive market like restaurant industry, understading the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders. Utilizing the Yelp dataset, this project aims to investigate the relationship between user engagement(reviews, tips and check-ins) and business success metrics (review count, ratings) for restaurants.

## Research Objectives:

Quantify the correlation between user engagement (reviews, tips, check_ins) and review count/average star rating: This will help us determine if restaurants with higher user engagements experience a corresponding increase reviews and ratings

Analyze the impact of sentiment on review count and average star rating: We will investigate if positive sentiment in reviews and tips translates to higher star ratings and potentially the total number of reviews left.

Time trends in User Enagament: We will explore if consistent user engagement over time is a stronger indicator of long-term success compared to sporadic burst of activity

## Hypothesis Testing

Higher levels of user engagement (more reviews, tips and check-ins) correlate with higher reveiw counts and ratings for restaurants. Positive sentiment expressed in reviews and tips contributes to higher overall ratings and reviews counts for restaurants. Consistent engagement over time is positively associated with sustained business success for restaurants.
